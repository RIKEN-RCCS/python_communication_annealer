# python_communication_annealer

This project reduces communication overhead in HPC (High Performance Computing) environments by applying simulated annealing in Python.
It also outputs the results in a visualized format such as images for easier interpretation.

## Environment Setup

It is recommended to use a virtual environment (e.g., `venv`) for this project.

Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv [env_name]
```

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes
* common.py contains shared components used across different network topology files.
* To run the program, please execute the specific script for the network topology you want to simulate.
